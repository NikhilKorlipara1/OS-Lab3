# OS-Lab3
Building a parallel run-length encoder called Not Your Usual ENCoder, or nyuenc for short.

In this lab, I:
- Familiarized myself with multithreaded programming using POSIX threads.
- Learned how to implement a thread pool using mutexes and condition variables.
- Learned how to use a thread pool to parallelize a program.
- Got a better understanding of key IPC concepts and issues.
- Became a better C programmer and am now better prepared for your future technical job interviews, and am now more prepared for interviews learning the data encoder algorithm.
